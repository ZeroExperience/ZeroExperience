- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZeroExperience
- 👀 I have a broad set of interests, like artificial intelligence, security, and infrastructure as code
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development while I finish my MS in data science
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on anything, really. Doing projects can be fun, and I'm not too stuck up to make a new friend
- 📫 How to reach me ... my LinkedIn is /samueljphoffman. Spam will of course be blocked, but I try to be nice otherwise
